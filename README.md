# Power-Bi-Customer-Churn
Project Overview
In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of customer churn data to uncover key trends and insights. The goal was to identify patterns and factors contributing to customer churn, allowing businesses to make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention.

Key Features
1: Data Preparation:
Imported and cleaned raw customer data, ensuring accuracy and consistency for analysis.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of variables and identify potential outliers.

2: Custom Metrics Using DAX:
Created custom DAX formulas to calculate key metrics such as churn rate, customer lifetime value, and average tenure.
Developed measures to segment customers by demographics, contract types, and tenure, enabling a more granular analysis.

3:Interactive Dashboards:
Designed and developed interactive dashboards in Power BI that allow users to explore churn data dynamically.
The dashboards include filters and slicers to drill down into specific customer segments, making it easy to identify at-risk groups.
Visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs were used to illustrate churn trends across different dimensions (e.g., gender, age, contract type).

4:Insights and Actionable Recommendations:
The analysis revealed that certain demographics and contract types were more prone to churn. For instance, customers with month-to-month contracts and those in the younger age groups exhibited higher churn rates.
Based on these findings, I provided actionable recommendations to the business, including targeted retention strategies for high-risk segments
